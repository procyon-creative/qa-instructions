# qa-instructions

Turns what an existing Playwright test does into instructions a person can follow by hand to check the same thing, with a screenshot for each step. Test authors change nothing in their tests.

## Language

**QA Instructions**:
The human-readable output for one test: a title, optional prerequisites, and an ordered list of QA Steps.
_Avoid_: test plan, script, report

**QA Step**:
One thing a person does in the browser to follow the test by hand, plus what they should see afterward.
_Avoid_: test step (that is Playwright's `test.step`)

**Action**:
The "do this" half of a QA Step: something a person can do in a browser, such as opening a URL, clicking, typing, choosing an option, or pressing a key. Test plumbing that a person cannot repeat (waits, scripts, reading values) is never an Action.

**Warning step**:
A QA Step placed where the test changed the page with a script instead of a user action (e.g. force-opening an accordion), telling the tester they may need to do something by hand to continue. It has no Highlight.

**Approximate**:
Said of an Action the test forced past the runner's usual checks (`force: true`); its Highlight may not line up.

**Secret**:
A value that must never appear in QA Instructions: text typed into a password field (as recorded on the page, not guessed from the test), or anything matching a configured mask pattern. It is shown as `[masked]`, and a step that typed a password tells the tester to type their own.

**Expected Result**:
The "you should see" half of a QA Step, taken from the test's own checks that follow the Action. A QA Step may have none.
_Avoid_: assertion (that is the test's code, not what the tester reads)

**Section**:
A named group of QA Steps, taken from a test's own grouping of its actions.

**Step Screenshot**:
The picture of the page at the moment of a QA Step's Action, with a Highlight on the element acted on.

**QA Report**:
What a test run produces with no extra steps: a browsable page listing every test's QA Instructions with their screenshots, plus each test's QA Instructions as Jira-ready text.
_Avoid_: bundle (the saved data the QA Report is made from)

**Result Screenshot**:
A second screenshot of a QA Step, taken after the Action, showing what its Expected Result describes. By default only the last QA Step has one, because the next step's Step Screenshot already shows the result of every other step. Which steps get one is a rule that can be changed, and overridden for a single step.

**Highlight**:
The mark drawn on a Step Screenshot to show which element the Action touched and, for clicks, where. Its style is configurable. An Approximate Action's outline is dashed.
_Avoid_: annotation (overloaded with Playwright test annotations)

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "The checkout test calls `waitForTimeout` and reads the cart's data attributes. Are those QA Steps?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. A tester can't repeat those. The QA Steps are opening the product page, entering 3, and clicking Purchase, and the Expected Result is that the cart shows 3."
