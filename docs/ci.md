# CI and runners

## GitHub-hosted (current default)

`procyon-creative/qa-instructions` is **public**, so Linux hosted runners are free. CI and E2E use `ubuntu-latest` today.

| Workflow                         | Runner          | When                      |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `ci.yml`                         | `ubuntu-latest` | Every PR + push to `main` |
| `e2e.yml`                        | `ubuntu-latest` | Push to `main` only       |
| `jira.yml`, `release-please.yml` | `ubuntu-latest` | Events as configured      |

## Self-hosted on `ruby`

Use the homelab runner on **`ruby`** when hosted Actions are not enough:

- Private repos under `procyon-creative` (hosted minutes bill the org)
- Jobs that need heavy Playwright/browser caches, Docker, or long runtimes
- Anything blocked on the org's free hosted quota

**Do not** attach a repo-scoped self-hosted runner to a **public** repo unless jobs are restricted to trusted refs only (e.g. push to `main` from upstream, not fork PRs). Fork PRs can execute workflow code on the host.

### Pattern (from `resume-builder`)

```yaml
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux]
    timeout-minutes: 20
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # …
```

### Provision a runner

Private repo only. See `add-self-hosted-runner` skill:

- Host: `ruby`
- Container: `gh-runner-<owner>-<repo>`
- Labels: `self-hosted,linux`
- Env: `/etc/gh-runner/<owner>-<repo>.env`

Registration (one-time):

```bash
gh api -X POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runners/registration-token --jq .token
# → set RUNNER_TOKEN in env file, start container on ruby
```

### Switching this repo to `ruby`

When needed (e.g. repo goes private or org minute limits bite):

1. Provision runner on `ruby` for the target repo (private).
2. Change `runs-on` in `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` (and optionally `ci.yml`) to `[self-hosted, linux]`.
3. For public repos, gate self-hosted jobs:

   ```yaml
   if: github.event_name == 'push' || github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository
   ```

   so fork PRs stay on `ubuntu-latest`.

## Local verification

Before push (saves hosted/self-hosted cycles):

```bash
pnpm verify   # examples/verification: test → render → golden probes
```
